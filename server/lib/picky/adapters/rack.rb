module Adapters

  # This is an adapter that is plugged into a Rack outlet.
  #
  # It looks at what is given to it and generate an appropriate
  # adapter for it.
  #
  # For example, if you give it a query, it will extract the query param etc.
  # and call search_with_text on it if it is called by Rack.
  #
  # Usage:
  #   Adapters::Rack.app_for(thing, options)
  #
  module Rack
  
    # Generates the appropriate app for Rack.
